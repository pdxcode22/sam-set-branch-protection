# sam-set-branch-protection

This is a [SAM app](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/) which consists of an [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) and a [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

The lambda is triggered by a Github webhook configured on your org. The lambda will configure branch protections on the default branch of your repo. The lambda will also create an issue in the repo summarizing the branch protections added. An @mention will be included in the issue for the user configured in the stack. Be sure to create your repos with a README file so the default branch exists when the lambda is triggered by the webhook. 

## Deploying the stack from your localhost

1. [Install AWS sam cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
2. Setup creds in AWS for cli with a profile
3. run `export AWS_PROFILE=<your profile>`
4. run `sam build`
5. run `sam deploy --guided`

Subsequent deploys to the same stack to the default environment...

1. run `sam build`
1. run `sam deploy`

## Deploying the stack from GitHub actions
Add the following secrets to your fork of this repo to deploy the stack via GitHub actions:  
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID  
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY  
SECRET  ## Shared secret used in webhook  
GH_TOKEN  ## Personal GitHub access token  
NOTIFY_USER  ## The GitHub user to be mentioned in the issue created  

## Setup Github webhook
1. Go to your Org webhook settings in GitHub. `https://github.com/organizations/<your org name>/settings/hooks`
2. Click `Add webhook`
3. Use the cloudformation output value for key=processWebhookApiEndpoint as the `Payload URL`
4. Use the same secret used in the stack deployment
5. Choose `Let me select individual events.`
6. Deselect `Pushes`
7. Select `Repositories`
8. Click `Add webhook` at the bottom of the page

## Running:
 `sam local invoke processWebhook -n vars.json -e src/processWebhook/event.json`

 ## Debugging:
`sam local invoke -d 9999 processWebhook -n vars.json -e src/processWebhook/event.json`  
Then in VSCode run the `Attach to lambda` profile
